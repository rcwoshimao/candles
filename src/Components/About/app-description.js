Candles is an interactive map application that allows you to place emotional markers (candles) on a global map. Each candle represents a feeling or emotion, creating a visual representation of emotional experiences across the world.

This website is created as a quiet, symbolic space for reflection and shared presence.  
> The emotions used here were inspired by https://feelingswheel.com/, and the general idea is inspired by https://www.queeringthemap.com/. 

# FAQ 
### How does it work? 
Each candle represents a unique emotion placed by real users around the world.  To create your own candle, follow the instruction of the candle creator "+" at the bottom of your screen. 

### Why is there not a feature to attach a message to our candles? 
This project is run as a small, lightweight non-profit initiative. Allowing free-form text would significantly increase the need for moderation and security measures, including protection against misuse, harmful content, or data injection.  
To keep the platform safe, sustainable, and easy to maintain, we’ve chosen to limit markers to non-textual inputs. While written messages could be meaningful, this decision helps ensure the project can continue to exist responsibly. 

While we don’t support written messages, we’re exploring other expressive ways to let people share meaning through symbols, colors, and interactions.



Yes, there's definitely repetition — the Data & Privacy section and the Content & Data section in the Terms cover largely the same ground, and the Community Guidelines overlap with the Limitations section too. Here's a tightened version:


# Terms of Service

By using this Website, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. **If you do not agree to these terms, you are not permitted to access or use our services.**

These terms were last updated on Febuary 1, 2026.

## Your Responsibilities

You are responsible for your contributions to this platform. You agree not to use this site in ways that violate applicable laws, harm or harass others, misrepresent your identity or the site's purpose, or interfere with the service. Each candle represents your individual perspective, and contributions do not reflect the views of this project or its creators.

## Privacy & Data

We collect only what's necessary to operate the platform: candle data (emotion, location, timestamp), a unique anonymous browser identifier to track your own candles, and aggregate usage statistics. We do not collect personal information, email addresses, or anything that identifies you as an individual. All candle data is publicly visible on the map. We do not sell or share data with third parties.

## Limitations & Disclaimers

This is an artistic and reflective space — not a crisis support service or mental health resource. If you need professional support, please contact appropriate services in your area. We cannot monitor or moderate individual contributions. This project operates as a small, independent initiative and may change, pause, or be discontinued at any time without notice.

## Changes

These terms may be revised at any time. Continued use of the service constitutes agreement to the current terms.
