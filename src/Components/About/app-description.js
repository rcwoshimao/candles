Candles is an interactive map application that allows you to place emotional markers (candles) on a global map. Each candle represents a feeling or emotion, creating a visual representation of emotional experiences across the world.

This website is created as a quiet, symbolic space for reflection and shared presence.  
> The emotions used here were inspired by https://feelingswheel.com/, and the general idea is inspired by https://www.queeringthemap.com/. 

# How does it work? 
Each candle represents a unique emotion placed by real users around the world.  To create your own candle, follow the instruction of the candle creator "+" at the bottom of your screen. 

# Why not allow people to write something for their candles? 
This project is run as a small, lightweight non-profit initiative. Allowing free-form text would significantly increase the need for moderation and security measures, including protection against misuse, harmful content, or data injection.  
To keep the platform safe, sustainable, and easy to maintain, we’ve chosen to limit markers to non-textual inputs. While written messages could be meaningful, this decision helps ensure the project can continue to exist responsibly. 

While we don’t support written messages, we’re exploring other expressive ways to let people share meaning through symbols, colors, and interactions.


# Data & Privacy

Your candles are publicly visible on the map. When you create a candle, the following information is stored and displayed:
- Your selected emotion
- The location (latitude/longitude) where you placed it
- The timestamp of when it was created

**What we collect:**
- A unique, anonymous identifier stored in your browser (to track your own candles)
- Candle data (emotion, location, timestamp)
- Usage statistics (aggregate, anonymous)

**What we don't collect:**
- Personal information (name, email, etc.)
- IP addresses (beyond what's necessary for server functionality)
- Any identifying details about you as an individual

All candle data is publicly viewable as part of the collective map. Your browser identifier remains local to your device and is not linked to your identity.

This is a free, non-commercial project. We do not sell or share data with third parties.

## Community Guidelines & Responsibility

**Individual Expression**   
Each candle on this map represents the individual perspective and experience of the person who created it. These contributions reflect personal feelings and do not represent the views, values, or positions of this project, its creator, or the platform itself.

**Not a Support Service**   
This platform is an artistic and reflective space, not a crisis support service, mental health resource, or therapeutic tool. If you are experiencing a crisis or need professional support, please contact appropriate mental health services in your area.

**Content Responsibility**   
While we aim to maintain a respectful space, we cannot monitor, moderate, or be responsible for individual user contributions. The collective map emerges from community participation, and we ask users to engage thoughtfully and respectfully with this shared space.

**Project Continuity**   
This project operates as a small, independent initiative. The platform may change, be updated, or be paused at any time without notice. While we hope to maintain it, we cannot guarantee continuous availability or specific features.
